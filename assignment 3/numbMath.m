function [sumVal, diffVal, prodVal, maxVal] = numbMath(a, b) % calling all numbers numb bc im getting sick and i myself am numb
% my inputs are (a, b) aka numbs, outputs are all the vals listed below
% copilot gave the option to auto add everything so i did that but let it
% be known i was going to do it anyways
sumVal = a + b; % this one adds
diffVal = a - b; % this one subtracts (a minus b)(these feel like they don't need explained but u wanted comments so enjoy)
prodVal = a * b; % this one multiplies wow!
maxVal = max(a, b); % this one picks the larger number very cool
end
